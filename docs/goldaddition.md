# Registration of gold as tokens

When physical gold in the vault is registered on the chain to be usable as gold tokens, new tokens have to be created.

## Implementation
The [default rivine minting extension](https://github.com/threefoldtech/rivine/tree/master/extensions/minting) is used for this with a multisignature condition.
