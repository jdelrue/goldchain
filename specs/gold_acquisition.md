 # Gold Acquisition

## Using Fiat

 Questions:

 - Need a price
 - Which are accepted
 - How long is an offer valid?
 - Is the price determined at offer agreement or at at money receival?
 ## Regular money transfer

 The offer needs to be registered somewhere.

 I suggest the user does not have to go through KYC and address authorization before accepting and making the payment in order to keep the onboarding process low entry. The user can do so later to really have the Gol tokens in it's wallet.
